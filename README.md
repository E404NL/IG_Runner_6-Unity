# IG_Runner_6
In case of my studies, i made this project for my 4th year's final exam.
The objective was to prove i can made a full-stack application, and i choose to do a video-game with with Unity a back-end application (for user datas) with java spring boot.
In this git, it's only the video game, the back-end is actually on git-lab. 


Instinct Runner is a video game requested by Instinct Gaming, a computer sales company that offers complete PC assembly, PC component sales, and peripherals. The company aims to establish itself in the gaming and video game world in France.
The objective of this game is to meet the brand's marketing needs through animation. They envisioned a game that could be played on a stationary animation during conventions or esports tournaments, which would be simple, fast-paced, and minimally challenging without being overly complex. They also wanted to offer prizes to one or more winners, either through a raffle or a general ranking of the game.
This is why a "runner" type game perfectly meets their needs. The concept of a runner game is simply to go as far as possible on a track while collecting as many collectibles as possible to increase the score based on the distance covered, while avoiding obstacles. Depending on the type of runner game, a race typically lasts between 10 and 180 seconds, depending on the game's difficulty and the player's skill level.

Instinct Runner will be developed with the following objectives:
- A person can register and participate.
- They are entitled to 3 races to have a minimum gameplay experience.
- They can disconnect and reconnect between 2 races if desired.
- They can view their game statistics and ranking.

This application has been designed using multiple technologies:
- Backend: Java Spring Boot application, utilizing a MySQL database.
- Frontend: Unity application, a versatile and user-friendly game engine for creating interactive 2D and 3D experiences on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, and Linux).
- During this meeting, weâ€™ll talk about the back-end application.
